5. **Note loading times** - First request vs. subsequent requests

## FAQ

### Q: Why does the first request take so long?
**A**: The cloud AI service needs to "warm up" on first use (cold start). Subsequent requests are much faster.

### Q: Can I change my Tester ID?
**A**: Currently no, but you can clear extension data in `chrome://extensions` and reinstall to set a new ID.

### Q: Does this work offline?
**A**: No, it requires internet connection to communicate with the AI API.

### Q: What data is collected?
**A**: We collect:
- Your Tester ID (anonymous identifier you chose)
- Which features you use
- Feedback on extraction accuracy (when you click thumbs up/down)
- We do NOT collect personal information or browse your other tabs

### Q: Why does it need "storage" permission?
**A**: To save your Tester ID so you don't have to enter it every time.
